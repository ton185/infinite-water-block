https://modrinth.com/mod/MOD

https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/MOD



## What?
A block that provides infinite water to nearby blocks or anything capable of interacting with fluids
Feature list:
- Automatically push water to all sides
- Ability to input water (this will void the water that was piped in)
- Optionally require a redstone signal to push water

**You can configure all of the above as you want**, here is the full list of things you can configure:
- pushing water automatically
- requiring redstone to push
- accepting (voiding) water
- amount to push
- amount of tanks the block has
- water amount per tank
I have not provided a detailed descriptions of the configs here as the config file itself has detailed comments.
Please note that the maximum value for all numbers in the config is Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647). Going higher wont work


Default recipe:
```

O = obsidian
W = water bucket
P = packed ice

**If you want me to port this mod to another version of forge/neoforge then make an issue here.**
